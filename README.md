# CheerBot
- Creates Smart Facebook Messenger Chatbot With Node.js And Api.ai (NLP)

Feeling lonely? Need someone to talk? Feel stressed out after work? Well, you can now chat with your virtual friend, the CheerBot.

CheerBot is a chatbot built using Natural language processing . The CheerBot can interact with the users, send images , send jokes and send gifs based on user preferences. A user can interact with the bot in Facebook messenger. I am hosting the Chatbot with the help of Facebook developer platform. 

The work flow : 
- Initially the bot is trained using Dialogflow API 
- When a user enters a message it is captured by the messenger and its been forwarded to the backend via Facebook developer. - At the back end I am using node.js and routes to process the request 
- After formulating the response with the help of NLP, it is send via Facebook developer back into the messenger
